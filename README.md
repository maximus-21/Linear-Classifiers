# Linear-Classifiers
This is the implementation of two linear classifiers - Logistic Regression and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) from scratch. The aim is to see how both the classifier works and how they differ from each other. This also gives us a peek into generative and discriminative algorithms.

**logreg.py** - Implementation of Logistic Regression.<br>
**gda.py** - Implementation of Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) Algorithm.<br>
**utils.py** - Include utilities- loading dataset, adding intercept and plotting.<br>
