# Linear-Classifiers
This is the implementation of two linear classifiers - Logistic Regression and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) from scratch. The aim is to see how both the classifier works and how they differ from each other. This also gives us a peek into generative and discriminative algorithms.
